I'm skipping the rest of ch3 :(
I'm running out of motivation doing math problems, and streams are cool but I feel
like I've done enough stream-related stuff with Python iterators, maybe?
I'm doing SICP to get to the interpreter/compiler stuff, so I'm gonna skip ahead
to Ch4 and if I'm really lacking an understanding of streams/delayed evaluation
then I'll come back to ch3.
